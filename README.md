# DCASE2019 Task 1b
DCASE2019 Task 1b - Acoustic Scene Classification with mismatched recording devices 


## Description
This repository contains CP-JKU Student team's submission for [DCASE Challenge 2019](http://dcase.community/challenge2019/). A technical report describing this system will be available on the DCASE homepage as soon as official evaluation results are available. We need to stress that self trained results might differ slightly from the ones described in the report, since we do not seed the random number generator manually. We therefore additionally provide all the files necessary to recreate our submissions in  folders `tmp/data/{no_da, mse_da_0, mse_da_1, mi_da}`.

For a detailed description of task, data set, and baseline, see:

## Step-by-Step Guide for Prediction & Training

As a first step we need to set up the environment:
- Clone this project to you local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/OptimusPrimus/dcase2019_task1b.git
    ```
- Download and place data set into the data folder:
    ```
    .
    │
    └───data
    .   └───raw
    .       └───dcase20191b
    .           |   create_folds.py
    .           |   meta.csv 
    .           └───submission                           # submission data
    .           .   |   1.wav
    .           .   |   ...
    .           └───test                                # leaderboard data
    .           .   |   1.wav
    .           .   |   ...
    .           └───audio                               # training
    .           .   |   tram-vienna-285-8639-a.wav
    .           .   |   ...
    .           └───evaluation_setup                    # evaluation split
    .           .   |   fold1_evaluate.csv 
    .           .   |   fold1_test.csv
    .           .   |   fold1_train.csv
    .           └───training_setup                      # empty, 4-flod CV split
    |   ...
    
    ```

- Import conda environment & activate it: 
    ```
    conda env create -f environment.yaml && source activate slap
    ```
- Create folds:
    ```
    cd data/raw/dcase20191b
    python create_folds.py
    cd ../../..
    ```
- Install Omniboard:
    
    ```
    npm install -g omniboard
    ```
- Install & Setup MongoDB ([more here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/))
- Create Database (e.g. use dcase20191b)
- Add file `mongodb.json` with MongoDB credentials to root: 
    ```json
    {
      "user": "username",
      "pwd": "password123",
      "ip": "127.0.0.1",
      "db": "dcase20191b",
      "port": 27017
    }
    ```
- [OPTIONAL] Add file `telegram.json` with Telegram Bot credentials to root: 
    ```json
    {
      "token": "SecretToken",
      "chat_id": "ChatID"
    }
    ```


### Predict

Use the provided training files to create predictions for leaderboard and evaluation set.
The command to create predictions is:
```
python predict.py model_id_0 [model_id_1 model_id_2 ...]
```
To create all submission files simply run:
```
python predict.py no_da && python predict.py mse_da_0 && python predict.py mi_da && python predict.py mse_da_0 mse_da_1
```
The submission files can be found in directory `data\tmp`.

### Train the System Yourself
- Start MongoDB:
    ```
    mongod
    ```

- Activate conda environment:
    ```
    source activate slap
    ```
- Edit `configs/dcase20191b.json`
- Train MSE, MI, and NoDA models with:
    ```
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py
    ```
    ```
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py with training.domain_adaptation.class=domain_adaptation.MSE
    ```
    ```
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py with training.domain_adaptation.class=domain_adaptation.MutualInformationDA
    ```
   
See [Sacred CLI Description](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html) on how to manipulate training parameters.
Trained models can be found in folder `data/tmp`.
To see training progress, start Omniboard:
```
omniboard -m 127.0.0.1:27017:dcase20191b
```
